  <h2>Welcome to FlexChange</h2>
  <p>
    We created this application at the <a href="https://hackzurich.com">HackZurich</a> for the <a href="https://credit-suisse.com">Credit Suisse Group AG</a>. The idea was to shape the bank of the future.
    We all know, that when you are going on vacation, on an exchange or just in an other country, you need to have the native currency. The exchange rate is not always the best. But what if we could change that?
  </p>
  <h4>What is FlexChange?</h4>
  <p>
    FlexChange gives you the opportunity to plan your currency exchange. You can deposit an amount of money and we will exchange it for you when it is the best time for it.
    Our Algorithm is calculating the best time to exchange the money from your currency into the desired currency, providing you the best exchange rate.
  </p>
  <p>
    We think, that we all need to save money where it is possible. Why not starting to exchange it at the best moment?
